## Styling

The components use Tailwind CSS classes for styling and include custom CSS utilities defined in `src/styles/music-redesign.css`. Make sure to import this stylesheet in your application.

## Integration with Existing Systems

These components are designed to work with the existing music player context and playlist context. They maintain compatibility with the existing API structure while providing a modern UI layer.

## Responsive Design

All components are built with responsive design principles and will adapt to different screen sizes:
- Mobile: Single column layout with collapsible sidebar
- Tablet: Two column layout with expanded sidebar
- Desktop: Multi-column layout with full sidebar

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of these components by:
1. Modifying the Tailwind CSS classes directly
2. Adding custom CSS classes in `src/styles/music-redesign.css`
3. Extending the components with additional props for customization

These components require the following dependencies:
- `react-icons` for icon components
